# Simple Python Calculator

A basic command-line calculator written in Python that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features
- Supports basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Allows continuous calculations until `=` is entered
- Handles invalid operators with an error message
- Prevents division by zero

## How to Use
1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter the first number.
3. Enter an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
4. Enter the next number.
5. Continue entering operations and numbers.
6. Enter `=` to display the final result.

## Example Usage



## Error Handling
- If an invalid operator is entered, it displays `"INVALID OPERATOR"` and asks for input again.
- If division by zero is attempted, it prints `"Invalid operation"` and prompts for a new input.
